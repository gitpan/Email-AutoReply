[ ] user preferences config file
[ ] check for an X-Spam-Level header and don't send if hits are at a
    certain threshold (configurable)
[ ] don't send email to an address with 'subscribe' in the user name,
    ala tomcat-dev-subscribe@jakarta.apache.org
[ ] reply to "Reply-To:" header if available (configurable)
[ ] ability to save a copy of outgoing message
[ ] support for re-sending autoreply after a time period has elapsed
[ ] implement 'already sent to' storage mechanism with pluggable backend
[ ] path separators are hardcoded as forward-slashes (not
    cross-platform) use File::Spec->catdir() instead
[ ] not using Berkeley DB transactions
[ ] not using Berkeley DB locking
[ ] Email::AutoReply::Filter
[ ]   can't actually filter message... Email::Filter throws out the
      envelope sender or procmail isn't giving it to us, or we need to
      build it, or maybe I'm just doing something wrong, or ...?
[ ] unit tests

[X] sender shouldn't be taken from "To:" header since this can change.
    This needs to be a configurable option.
[X] add everything to Subversion or cvs
[X] Email::Filter::AutoReply
