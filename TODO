[ ] ability to save a copy of outgoing message
[ ] support for re-sending autoreply after a time period has elapsed
[ ] implement 'already sent to' storage mechanism with pluggable backend
[ ] add everything to Subversion or cvs
[ ] path separators are hardcoded as forward-slashes (not
    cross-platform)
[ ] not using Berkeley DB transactions
[ ] not using Berkeley DB locking
[ ] Email::AutoReply::Filter
[ ]   can't actually filter message... Email::Filter throws out the
      envelope sender or procmail isn't giving it to us, or we need to
      build it, or maybe I'm just doing something wrong, or ...?
