Email-AutoReply
===========================

Email::AutoReply is a Perl extension for writing email autoresponders.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

An example vacation autoresponder is available at examples/on_vacation.
You'll need Getopt::Declare installed for it to work.

I made a vacation autoresponder with procmail by adding the following
recipe to my ~/.procmailrc after all other recipes:

  :0 c
  | on_vacation

on_vacation is in my path. Note that 'sendmail' must also be in your
path if you're using the default send_method for Email::AutoReply.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Spiffy, File::Path, Email::Address, Email::Send, Email::Simple,
  Mail::ListDetector, Test::More

If you are using Email::AutoReply::DB::BerkeleyDB for cachedb_type
(the default), the following other modules must be installed:

  BerkeleyDB

This module uses Email::Send's sendmail send method by default, which
means sendmail must be in your path.
